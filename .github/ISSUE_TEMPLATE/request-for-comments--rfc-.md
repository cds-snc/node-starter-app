## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the change.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Design Detail

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the infrastructure to understand. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the service is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on users,
on the integration of this change with other existing and planned features etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.



## Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

> How other services / infrastructures in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilisation?

> What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
