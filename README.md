[![Total alerts](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/cds-snc/node-starter-app.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/cds-snc/node-starter-app/alerts/) [![Language grade: JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/javascript/g/cds-snc/node-starter-app.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/cds-snc/node-starter-app/context:javascript)

**Demo:** https://cds-node-starter.herokuapp.com

**Changelog:** [changelog.md](https://github.com/cds-snc/node-starter-app/blob/master/changelog.md)

This repository provides a codebase that can be used to quickly build web pages or forms with a Government of Canada look-and-feel. 

It provides the following functionality:

- Create web pages that look like GC pages
- Add endpoints ([routes/URLs](#adding-routes)) for web form workflows, complete with [form validation](#form-validation)
- Prevents [forged cross-site requests](#form-csrf-protection)
- Translation ready, [using name/value pairs configs](#locales)
- Fast deployment, currently for:
  - [Amazon Web Services](cdk) via [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
  - [Azure](terraform/readme.md) via [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
  - [Google Cloud Platform](cloudbuild.yaml) via [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/)
- Continuous integration checks that run automatically via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - [Accessibility](.github/workflows/a11y.yml)
  - [Code Styling / Linting]((.github/workflows/nodejs.yml))
  - Scanning codebase for [accidental secret leaking]((.github/workflows/secret.yml))

It's setup with some sensible defaults and tech choices, such as:

- Node.js >= 10.x
- NVM (Node Version Manager) for install Node.js versions
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) view templates
- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) for reusable styles
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) a utility-first css framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/)

## Cloning and pulling upstream changes

1. Create an `empty` Github repo (**must be empty**)

```bash

git remote add upstream git@github.com:cds-snc/node-starter-app.git
git pull upstream master
git remote -v // ensure the remotes are setup properly

// you should see
origin  git@github.com:cds-snc/your-repo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:cds-snc/your-repo.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:cds-snc/node-starter-app.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:cds-snc/node-starter-app.git (push)
```

## Install + Dev Mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Custom styles, Sass, PostCSS, TailwindCSS, and PurgeCSS

There is a base set of SASS stylesheets included by default that provide a good base visual starting point.

TailwindCSS is included, but completely optional. If you don't like it, you can just remove the @tailwind directives in app.scss, remove the tailwind.scss customizations, and remove the tailwindcss plugin from postcss.config.js.

Webpack loads app.scss and imported sheets, runs them through PostCSS which parses SASS, sets up Tailwindcss, compiles, minimizes with cssnano, and applies autoprefixer. On production builds, everything gets passed through PurgeCSS to remove any unused classes to really reduce file size.

app.scss is where we recommend you place custom SASS or CSS rules.


## Adding Routes
Generate the route files
```
node ./bin/route.js create --route your_route_name
```

The created route directory by default contains the following files:
- your_route_name.controller.js
- your_route_name.pug
- schema.js (used for form views)


Register the route via [routes.config.js](https://github.com/cds-snc/node-starter-app/blob/master/config/routes.config.js)

```javascript
// config/routes.config.js
...
const routes = [
  { name: "your_route_name", path: "/your_route_name" },
];
...
```

Note: Delete unused route(s) directories as needed.

## Form step redirects

Redirects are handled via `route.doRedirect()`. The doRedirect function will do a look up for the next route based on the routes config.

For cases where the redirect is not straight forward you can pass in a function, which can return a route name or a route object:

```javascript
// routes.config.js
const routes = [
  ...
  { name: 'my-route', ..., skipTo: 'other-route' }
  ...
]

// my-route.controller.js
route.draw(app)
  .post(..., route.doRedirect((req, res) => shouldSkip(req) ? route.skipTo : route.next))
```

## Form CSRF Protection

CSRF protection for forms is provided by [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) middleware.

Note that the CSRF token is passed to all templates through response.locals, ie:

```javascript
// append csrfToken to all responses
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.locals.csrfToken = req.csrfToken()
  next()
})
```

To successfully submit a form, you must include a CSRF token in a hidden field:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="{{ csrfToken }}">
```

If using JS/Ajax, you can get the csrf token from the header meta tag included in the base template:

```html
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrfToken }}">
```

The following is an example of using the Fetch API to post to the `/personal` route with the CSRF token from the `<meta>` tag on the page:

```javascript
// Read the CSRF token from the <meta> tag
var token = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content')

// Make a request using the Fetch API
fetch('/process', {
  credentials: 'same-origin', // <-- includes cookies in the request
  headers: {
    'CSRF-Token': token // <-- is the csrf token as a header
  },
  method: 'POST',
  body: {
    favoriteColor: 'blue'
  }
})
```

## Locales

Text on pages is supplied via ids

```pug
block variables
  -var title = __('personal.title')

block content

  h1 #{title}

  div
    p #{__('personal.intro')}
  form(method='post')
```

```json
// locales/en.json
"personal.title": "Personal Information",
"personal.intro": "Intro copy goes here",
"form.fullname": "Full name",
```

## Form Validation

- Form validation is built into the form schema files and use [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js#validators) to validate input

> To mark fields showing as required you can pass required: true as an attribute
## Template Engine

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

## Common View Helpers

See views/_includes

## Change configuration

Don't like the way it's setup -> it's an Express server so do your thing `app.js`

## CLI

- There is a basic CLI tool that allows you to perform some functions:

```
> node ./bin/cli.js routes
[ { name: 'sample', path: '/sample' },
  { name: 'start', path: '/start' },
  { name: 'personal', path: '/personal' },
  { name: 'confirmation', path: '/confirmation' } ]
```

## Deployment

- The current default build and deploy is through GCP CloudBuild and Cloud Run. The `cloudbuild.yaml` will not work out of the box, so it will need to be tweaked as well as the permissions set correctly in GCP. [This link](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment-with-cloud-build#continuous) explains the required steps to set up Cloud Run properly.

## Goals

- Accessible out of the box
- Keep code routes / view(s) / schemas as portable (self-contained) as possible.
- If code i.e custom validators from the routes can be re-used it should be pulled up to the `app` level
- App level code (app.js) should be touched a little as possible when building a new app based on the starter
- Implement best practices from [Form design: from zero to hero all in one blog post](https://adamsilver.io/articles/form-design-from-zero-to-hero-all-in-one-blog-post)

> Routes should act like a plugin.
> i.e. Project B has a page you need, copy the route directory and add that route to your config.

## What this project is not

- This project aims to allow you to hit the ground running. It's not meant to be a be all end all defacto solution.


## Notes

This project is based on the orginal code https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits it was born out of wanting to use that code as a base without the need to remove the unused parts everytime a new project is started.

See:

- https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-demo-service/commit/ab24e79268626e1431b301fb91614b40f9615086
- https://github.com/cds-snc/2620-passport-renewal/commit/eb41bf83825b9d8c4a56427e0cd199ccc23089eb

> Starter Cloud Build / Cloud Run setup is in place if you prefer to deploy via GCP see `notification-demo-service` which is setup to deploy using a tag.
